# Build out regular CRUD and form_for Meal

  # Team One - Build the new/create controller methods with validation for name presence and uniqueness.  Build out form_for for new

  # Team Two - Build the edit/update controller methods with validation for name presence and uniqueness.  Build out form_for for edit

# Push up work - As a group, refactor this to have one form for both new and edit.  Copy created code to Dish, changing class references.

  # Build out one form_for Meal form that will allow you to assign a existing dish to a Meal.  

  # Build out Meal show page to display all dishes in the meal

  # Build out method for controlling Dish type to limit it to ('main', 'vegetarian', 'side', 'dessert')
