# Rails Oauth Challenge

Use the [OmniAuth Readme](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/omniauth_readme) to implement OmniAuth in the Thanksgiving App.

## Guidelines
  - create a user table with (minimally) columns for Facebook user id and email.
  - Have a user login via Facebook and create a session with the user's id.
  - Create logout functionality

It's up to you to decide how exactly you want to build these features. Add any migrations, models, controllers, and views you need.
